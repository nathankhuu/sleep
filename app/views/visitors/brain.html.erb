                    <h1>Sleep Deprivation and the Brain</h1>

                    <h3>Attention</h3>
                    <p>Evaluating sustained attention measured through the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) is considered the “gold standard of sleepiness” and is an objective way to measure sleep. A study (Van Dongen et al. 2003) had differing groups of hours of sleep per night (0, 4, 6, 8) and measured sleepiness with the PVT. It concluded that continued partial sleep deprivation can be as devastating as total deprivation. Another study (Belenky) again looked at differing groups of hours of sleep per night (3, 5, 7, 9), but measured objectively using the PVT and subjectively using patient responses. There was a dose-relationship between the hours of sleep and sleepiness. Also, as the sleep deprivation continued through the nights, performance continued to get worse; even after recovery nights, the dose-relationship was apparent. An important note is that the 7-hour group had similar subjective ratings of sleepiness as the 9-hour group, but performed worse than the 9-hour group. This shows that even if you feel adequately rested with less than a suitable number of hours of sleep, sleepiness is still objectively apparent even if one doesn’t subjectively “feel” it.</p>

    				<h3>Learning</h3>
    				<p>The benefits of sleep after learning is detailed in the “Sleep Benefits” section about memory, but being well rested before learning is also important. One study sleep deprived one group of subjects for one night, then participants learned the task, were given two recovery nights, and then tests. The control group had a similar process were but were well rested throughout the experiment. The results showed that those who were sleep deprived performed 40% worse on the task than those who were fully rested. This is because those who got sleep were able to refresh their ability for new learning, notably on the day the task was taught.</p>

    				<h3>Emotions</h3>
    				<p>The brain center for controlling emotions is called the amygdala. A study (Yao et al. 2007) showed participants a set of pictures ranging from neutral to negative, with one sleep deprived group and another well rested group. Those who were sleep deprived had 60% more brain reactivity in the amygdala than those who got normal sleep. The study showed that, with sleep, the prefrontal cortex is able to regulate the amygdala because it is strongly connected. Without sleep though, the connection between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala is severed, which results in an intense, emotional brain. </p>
