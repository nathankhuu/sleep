                    <h3>Creativity</h3>
                    <p>Sleep can play a large role in creativity. There are many societal anecdotes of sleep’s impact on creativity, with playing a role in the songs “Yesterday” and “Let It Be” by the Beatles. Sleep inspired novels such as as “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” by Robert Stevenson and “Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley. Jack Nicklaus used sleep to improve his golf technique and performance; similarly, Thomas Edison used sleep to help him come up with ideas for his inventions. Examples from science include Otto Loewi’s discovery of neurochemical transmission and Dmitri Mendeleev’s creation of the periodic table of elements. Beyond anecdotes and examples, a study (Wagner et al. 2004) showed the impact of sleep on creativity, in which participants were given a number reduction task. There is shortcut for the task that makes it simpler, and the study found that those who slept before being tested were about 35% more likely to discover the shortcut. </p>

    							<h3>Procedural Skills</h3>
    							<p>Sleep is important in learning procedural skills such as motor and visual skills. In one study, participants were given a finger-tapping motor task. Some participants were tested during the day, then before sleep, then after sleep. The other group was tested before sleep, after sleep, and once again later that day. Each test/retest had gaps of 12 hours between them. The study showed that the gap between before sleep and after sleep had the most significant improvement, regardless of when the participants were first tested. This showed that following learning, the brain will continue to improve across periods of sleep even in the absence of further practice. Another study used a visual discrimination task to look at visual skills. Participants were all trained on day 0, and then retested on different days depending on their group. The study showed that there was offline improvement over the few days. But one group was sleep deprived on the first night and retested on the third night, and performed poorest. As a whole, this study showed that it was the time asleep that led to improvement.</p>

			    				<h3>Declarative Memory</h3>
			    				<p>Sleep is important in retaining information and facts. A study (Jenkins 1924) studied 2 subjects and had them learn nonsense syllables. They repeated the experiment with each subject with and without sleep, so each participant would be in both conditions. During the testing, the participants were woken up in increments during sleep. The study found that sleep stabilizes declarative (or fact-based) memory, and offered immunity against forgetting those facts. Sleep is also important in integrating and associating memories. There have been multiple studies that have shown that sleep leads to associating memories deeper, abstracting connections, and helping the brain see the "big picture."</p>
