                    <h1>Sleep and Caffeine</h1>

				    				<h3>Two-Process Model of Sleep-Wake Regulation</h3>
				    				<p>The two-process model of sleep-wake regulation is the concept that there are two factors regulating the sleep-wake cycle. The first is Process-C, which is the drive to be awake and keeps at a constant up and down approximate 24-hour cycle, despite whether one is awake or asleep. The other factor is Process-S, which is the drive to sleep. The longer one is awake, the more pressure there is to sleep caused the by chemical adenosine. During sleep, adenosine dissipates. </p>

				    				<h3>Impact of Caffeine</h3>
				    				<p>Caffeine can have an impact on sleep-wake regulation. Caffeine does not simply give a person more energy, thatâ€™s not how it works. In actuality, it blocks the signal of adenosine, and tricks the brain to think that the person has not been awake for as long as they have. Once the caffeine is gone, the adenosine is no longer blocked and can lead to a caffeine crash. How does this affect sleep-wake regulation? For example, if caffeine is consumed at night, then the individual may not be able to sleep because they do not feel tired; in reality though, the brain is being tricked, and the person does need sleep but is not getting it.</p>
